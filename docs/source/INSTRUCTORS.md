# Guidance for Brainhack School Instructors


### Who can be an instructor at the Brainhack School?

Any graduate or postgraduate students or early career researchers affiliated with one of the Brainhack School hubs. 

### What skill sets and expertise are expected?

An instructor is expected to have a good understanding of how to conduct scientific research, expertise in one (or more) of neuroscience, psychology, statistics, or computational science, and be open to further developing their skill sets.


### What are the duties of an instructor?

- Familiarize themselves with the school practices and structure. 
- Familiarize themselves with module content and assignments. 
- Help students navigate the Discord course website and materials.
- Be present during the project pitches and wrap-up presentations. 
- Guide students with queries and give feedback on their projects.
- Keep track of the studentâ€™s progress.
- Report technical and practical problems to their local hub organizers.


### What are the benefits of being an instructor?

- Gaining practical and theoretical knowledge of the course materials.
- Improving teaching and mentorship skills.
- Peer working and collaborative research activities. 
- Being part of a network of researchers and students from various institutes across the globe.


### How many hours a day/week is an instructor expected to contribute? 

An instructor is expected to be present both in-person & online for a minimum of 3 hours a day (1 hour for the morning, 1 hour for the afternoon Q&Q/Clinic sessions, and 1 extra hour to reply to any questions), totaling approximately 60 hours throughout the school. The instructor will be compensated for their time and contributions. 

### How is an instructor associated with students?

Students and instructors will be matched based on overlapping research interests and skill sets in a pod to meet regularly.


### How is an instructor expected to communicate with the students?

The communication across the day is run through an international Discord server. The instructors will encourage students to use the module/project-related channels to raise their questions and get feedback from their peers.

Students will also have a chance to raise their questions during the Q&A hours when the instructor is expected to meet in person with the members of the pod they are assigned to.


### Does an instructor have to answer the questions from students from other hubs?

They are expected to but do not have to. Each hub will primarily be responsible for answering and helping its students. However, resolving some queries raised in the Discord server might address your expertise, or you might already know the answer. Then it would help the school community to resolve the issues quickly. 

### How will an instructor follow the progress of a student?  

For tracking the progress with students' completion of the module assignments, the local hub organizers that you are affiliated with will provide a means, mostly a shared sheet with the students' names and modules. So you will issue whether a student has completed an assignment based on their individual reporting.

For the project improvements and assignments, meeting with the students 2 times a day will give you likely observations regarding how a student is progressing with their needs and executions.

### What am I expected to do during a clinic/Q&A call?

During the Q&A hours in weeks 1 and 2, you are expected to catch up with the students regarding their module assignments and queries. 


During the clinic hours in weeks 3 and 4, you will track the student's progress with their project execution and share your feedback if they have any specific queries.

Please do not forget you are not expected to provide definite help or the correct answer. You are there to give feedback and point to the possible resources that might help them. 


### What should I do if a student is not progressing with their project?

Sometimes some students are stuck with an idea, choosing the right tool, or finding the data for their project. In some cases, they might also be hesitant to raise their questions. 

The best way to help those students would be to ask what aspect of their project is preventing them from progressing and give feedback to them to narrow down their project scope to facilitate execution.

Please remember you are there to provide means for students to progress rather than tackling the question together. You are not expected to boggle down the code or execute a task for them, or not to micro-manage their progress but to give them insight and guidance regarding how they can move forward in a possible way. 



### What should I do if a student needs to complete module assignments?

Similar to project executions, sometimes students might struggle with finishing the modules and the assignments due to technical struggles or time concerns because of other commitments they have. 

In such cases, reach students to hear the reason that lags them behind. If it is a technical problem request them to raise their problem in the Discord channels to get more help. Please contact the local hub organizers for their advice if it is due to the need for more time. 

Please remind yourself that strict requirements are especially expected for the students who take the course as a credited course. 

### What should I do if a student claims they are already proficient in some modules and would like to be excluded from finishing the module issued as those modules are completed?

Ask them for previous work that might show their proficiency in the modules. For eg., some students might be competent in using git/GitHub already, and they might have a repository and share the link with you. 

However, please remember to keep the engagement and requests on kind terms rather than an obligatory ones.
